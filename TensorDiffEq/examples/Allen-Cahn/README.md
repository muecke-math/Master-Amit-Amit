## Discrete Forward Allen-Cahn Equation

Given the non-linear AC equation:

$$u_t - 0.0001u_{xx} + 5u^3 - 5u = 0,$$
$$u(0, x) = x^2 \cos(\pi x),$$
$$u(t,-1) = u(t, 1),$$
$$u_x(t,-1) = u_x(t, 1),$$

with $x \in [-1, 1]$ and $t \in [0, 1]$, we adopt Rungeâ€“Kutta methods with q stages. The neural network output is:
$$[u^n_1(x),\dots, u^n_q(x), u^n_{q+1}(x)]$$
where $u^n$ is data at time $t^n$. We extract data from the exact solution at $t_0 = 0.1$ aiming to predict the solution at $t_1 = 0.9$ using a single time-step of $\Delta t = 0.8$.
